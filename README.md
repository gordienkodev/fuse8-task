# SPA for fuse8

This application allows users to search for characters by name using a provided API. Upon opening the page, the user sees only the search bar, which automatically gains focus for convenience. When the user types more than three characters, a request is sent to the API to retrieve matching results. Each character card links to a dedicated page displaying detailed information.

### Technical Requirements
- Responsive design (320px to 1920px, pixel-perfect not required)
- Browser support: Latest Chrome version
- Built with React
###  Features
- Search bar automatically focuses on page load
- API request triggers after typing at least three characters
- Each character card links to a details page
